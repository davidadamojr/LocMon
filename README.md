# LocMon 
LocMon is an Android app that does the following:
* It enables users to start and stop the collection and storage of location information.
* When users initiate data collection, the app collects and stores finely grained longitude and latitude information about the device's location. The user can stop this data collection at any time by pressing a stop button.
* Users can erase all data collected by the app.
* The app allows users to export all collected location information by sending a JSON file containing all the data to an email address that they specify.

For me, this was simply an experiment. However, it might be useful to many others who intend to learn about Android or for research studies that require real-world location information.
